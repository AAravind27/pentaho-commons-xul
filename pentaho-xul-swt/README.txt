This project requires the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) both to compile and during runtime.  
Please download a zip distribution from http://www.eclipse.org/swt/, unzip, and add swt.jar
to your eclipse classpath.  The Eclipse classpath is configured to expect swt.jar in the
dev-lib folder by default.
